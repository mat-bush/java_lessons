This directory is for the purposes of storing java code witten for an
auditted coursera java course. The code published will be my own,
but will be based off reasources provided by the course. The purpose of creatingmy own versions of java files they have already provided is two-fold.
Reason 1: It provides more experience with actually using java and its syntax


Reason 2: The software they have written for the course is built for using BlueJand needs some bluej packages to run. BlueJ will not run on my laptop due to 
arm issues. So in order to follow along with the course, I most work arounf thatissue.
